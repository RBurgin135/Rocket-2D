# Rocket-2D

This was one of the projects I made over the first Covid lockdown, when I was 16. I made it using Pygame and assets I created myself using microsoft paint. It is exclusively coded in python.

This project pits neural net driven rockets to land on a platform, it was inspired by the accomplishments of SpaceX. Mechanics are implemented using SUVAT arithmetic. This is a 2 dimensional version of the rocket problem I created. Rockets can run out of fuel and if they hit the ground too hard then they will be destroyed. Rockets can rotate and activate their engines to provide thrust. Following generation is cloned from the best performer from the previous generation. Performance is assessed by the agents speed when they make contact with the ground and the horizontal distance from the platform.
